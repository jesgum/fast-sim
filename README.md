# Hands-on: Fast simulations (WIP)
Repository for the fast simulation tutorial https://indico.cern.ch/event/1555608/.

The steps in this repository gives you an introduction to the tools that are available in the fast simulation.


## Step 0 -- Getting started
Preliminary step to make sure that our look-up tables valid and are located in the correct folder
- More information in folder /LUTs

## Step 1 -- Fast analysis
We try to run a simple analysis task with minimal configurations

## Step 2 -- Particle identification
Inspect output of particle identification tasks

## Step 3 -- Event generators
Switch from using built in generators to external ones. 

## Step 4
Run an analysis task than includes the tools from the previous steps, as well as the smearing of secondary particles
