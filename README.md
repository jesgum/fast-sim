# Hands-on: Fast simulations

## Step 0 -- Getting started
Preliminary step to make sure that our look-up tables valid and are located in the correct folder

## Step 1 -- Fast analysis
We try to run a simple analysis task with minimal configurations

## Step 2 -- Particle identification

## Step 3 -- Event generators
Switch from using built in generators to external ones. 

## Step 4 -- Fast sim with derived data
